"HP Hard Drives","NOTE: The components       of a storage subsystem (e.g. the drive the HBA/controller firmware and       the server backplane) should operate at the same data transfer rate or the       system bandwidth will be negotiated down to an acceptable level for all       components.      NOTE: Hard drives have either a one year or three year warranty;       refer to the specific hard drive QuickSpecs for details.","&nbsp;"
