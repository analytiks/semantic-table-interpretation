Can not be generated for dbo:fileSize as T2D has no additional information about table being vertical/horizontal.

# Comments
The table is a horizontal listing (or a vertical table).
It is probably about car storage which can carry 1 kayak, not lockable and adjustable.
T2D states that it is an owl:Thing, which has "adjustable" dbo:fileSize.
