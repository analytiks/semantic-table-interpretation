# Comments
This table is about stock prices.
T2D annotates the table class as owl:Thing, while it should be annotated as dbr:Stock_exchange, see for example [NASDAQ resource in DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/page/NASDAQ).
Also, columns could be possibly annotated as daily average, etc. (although column headers are missing, human annotator can use values to find actual meaning of the columns).
