# Comments

The subject column was identified the same as in T2D as well as dbo:rating property.
dbo:grades property was annotated by one annotator, however the second annotator marked the column as having property not present in DBpedia.
This can be attributed to the fact, that dbo:grades has rdfs:domain of dbo:School (and thus can not be used on dbo:Film).
T2DStar additionally annotates "Date" column as dbo:date.
