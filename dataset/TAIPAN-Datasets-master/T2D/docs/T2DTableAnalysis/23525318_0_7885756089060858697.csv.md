# Comments
T2D does not include any property annotations for this table.
T2DStar identifies "Bank name" as a subject column (i.e. will have rdfs:label property).
T2DStar annotators were able to identify dbo:country for "Country" column and dbo:currency for "Currency" column.
Also, column "SWIFT BIC" was annotated as having a property which is not in DBpedia.
