"Babethandaza","Daniel Hughes","Santa Barbara    Musical Press","South      Africa","Swahili","Arrangement originally performed by ?Sweet Honey on the    Rock.?"
"Niska Banja","Nick Page","Boosey and Hawkes","Serbian Gypsy (Rom) Dance","Romani","Unusual meter and rhythm makes this piece fun.? Note: the description states the origin is    Gypsy but they call themselves the Rom."
"Morning Song","James Green","Walton Music","Melody-American Words-Cherokee","Cherokee-Teehahnahmah is the proper name of the tribe","The melody is from Amazing    Grace but the words are written in Cherokee and blended with a    Teehahnahmah folk song called Morning    Song.? The arranger was careful to differentiate    the inspiration and history of his piece.?"
"Nzembo Na Mvula Zamba","Blair Bielawski","Lorenz Publishing Company","Congo    region of Africa","Lingala","I have not yet heard this transcription but I have heard    recordings of the BaMbuti tribe?s unique polyphony.? It is very intricate and differs from most    African styles.? An excellent    ethnography on the BaMbuti tribe is The Forest People by Colin    Turnbull.? Turnbull went into the    forest to work as an ethnic musicologist to record the BaMbuti?s music but wound    up writing the ethnography instead."
