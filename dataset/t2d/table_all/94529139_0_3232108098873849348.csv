"108000.","lauren markoe kolko","i use google every day. it's a great service. but the fact that an       anti-semitic website comes up - and as a first choice no less - in a       search for jew is very distressing. i hope google will make sure that it       is not inadvertently promoting anti-semitism. i will base my decision on       whether to keep using google on the company's response to this petition.       thank you lauren kolko"
